# FMRIB MR Spectroscopy Group

_This page is a work in progress, check back soon for more content._

Welcome to the website of the FMRIB Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy group. We're based in the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN), at the University of Oxford.

We are primarily interested in developing acquisition and analysis tools for multi-region spectroscopy (MRSI) of dynamic processes in the human brain.

## Software

A major output of the lab is its software, much of it centred around [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) and [FSL-MRS](http://www.fsl-mrs.com/).

#### Tools
- FSL-MRS - [documentation](http://www.fsl-mrs.com) - [development](https://github.com/wtclarke/fsl_mrs) - [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28630)
- NIfTI-MRS standard - [documentation](https://wtclarke.github.io/mrs_nifti_standard/) - [development](https://github.com/wtclarke/mrs_nifti_standard) - [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29418)
- NIfTI-MRS Software tools - [documentation](https://wtclarke.github.io/nifti_mrs_tools/) - [development](https://github.com/wtclarke/nifti_mrs_tools)
- Spec2nii (NIfTI-MRS Conversion) - [documentation](https://github.com/wtclarke/spec2nii) - [development](https://github.com/wtclarke/spec2nii) - [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29418)
- FSLEyes MRS plugin - [documentation](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/wclarke/fsleyes-plugin-mrs/install.html) - [development](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/wclarke/fsleyes-plugin-mrs) - [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29418)
- MRS Denoising Tools - [documentation](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/wclarke/low-rank-denoising-tools) - [development](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/wclarke/low-rank-denoising-tools) - [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29018)


To get to grips with FSL-MRS why not take a look at the spectreoscopy component of the [FSL Course](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fslcourse/website/index.html) or even attend this years course?

All tools are available to install through the _conda_ package manager.

## Open Science
The group is dedicated to publishing its science in an open way. As such all our core software is published open-source and should be available at the links above. Code used to generate paper outputs is also published.

We are proud to be involved with the [MRSHub](https://mrshub.org/) open-science repository and associated [forums](https://forum.mrshub.org/).

## Collaborators
The group is part of the [WIN Physics Group](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/research/physics-research), and maintains close links with the WIN [Physiological Neuroimaging Group](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/physiological-neuroimaging-group).

## Funding

Our work is funded by Wellcome through a Career Development Award [225924/Z/22/Z] to WTC and centre funding to WIN.
